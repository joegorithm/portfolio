### What is the purpose of this project?
This is my website that I will use as a central location to share _information_ about myself, develope my personal _brand_, and feature my past and upcoming coding _projects_.

I am building this project to gain experience with web development and have something to show for it. I'd specifically like to get more aquainted with these tools and skills:
- Git
- GitHub
- The command line
- Version control
- File management

I am currently only using plain `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, but I hope to integrate other technologies as I go.

### Where can I see the result?
View the current state of the live website at **[jh.codes](https://jh.codes/)**.
